Analyzed sales and shipping data to identify cost-saving opportunities and improve profitability. Used SQL for data extraction and logic validation, and Power BI for interactive dashboarding.

### Insights & Recommendations
*   **Shipping:** "Standard Class" shipping accounts for 60% of orders but has the lowest profit margin.
*   **Segments:** The "Consumer" segment drives the highest revenue but has a lower average order value than "Corporate."
*   **Action:** Recommended renegotiating rates for Standard Class shipping to improve margins.
